Step 1: Add a Check Box, and change the Grid to Canvas, naming the Canvas canvas
Step 2: Under Initialize Component, Add a rectangle and a ellipse
Set the colour of the circle to white, and move it to overlap the top end of the rectangle using set top and set left
*Make sure to add canvas.Children.Add(variable)
Step 3: Add the Rectangle a colour
Step 4: In the Check Box, set up a unchecked and a checked event (.xaml)
Step 5: Under the checked event, add a for loop, with another for loop nested inside, both representing different variables like this:
for (int j = 3; j < 7; j++)
        {
                for (int i = 2; i < 6; i++)
                {

		}
	}
Make sure the numbers inside each of the for loops are changed to match where your shirt is on the screen.
Step 6: Inside the second for loop, create an ellipse with your own parameters. Make sure to create a multipcation by and or j inside the SetLeft and SetTop so that it creates an even spacing between each dot.
Step 7: Add the same code under initalize Component into the unchecked event
Step 8: Add the following code in the .xaml to set up the sleaves on an angle:
<Rectangle Canvas.Left="" Canvas.Top="" Width="" Height="" Fill="">
            <Rectangle.RenderTransform>
                <RotateTransform Angle="" />
            </Rectangle.RenderTransform>
        </Rectangle>
        <Rectangle Canvas.Left="" Canvas.Top="" Width="" Height="" Fill="">
            <Rectangle.RenderTransform>
                <RotateTransform Angle="" />
            </Rectangle.RenderTransform>
			</Rectangle>
